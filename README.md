# Compiler-Project-In-Rust
Writing a compiler for a simple Go like language, to learn and teach Rust/Compilers. Work in progress

-- Taking a break from writing the compiler, to write a CPU emulator. 
Not because I can't finish a side project (kind of because I can't finish a side project)
but mostly because I want the back end to compiler to eventually output x86-64-linux Assembly/ ELF executable. And I feel like a deeper dive into Asm/CPU instruction sets would be a good idea prior to taking this on.
